            <center><h3>Speak Up: Turning Presence Into Influence in Leadership Meetings</h3></center>
            
            <p><b>Target audience:</b> Senior engineers, Engineering Managers and above</p>
            
            <p>In the fast-paced rhythm of leadership meetings, being invited into the room is only the beginning. True influence doesn't come from attendance. It comes from PRESENCE. As senior Engineer, how and when you speak shapes how others perceive your leadership, your credibility, and the value of your team. Quietly listening with good intentions may feel like respect, but to decision-makers, it can be read as disinterest, or worse, lack of conviction.</p>

            <p>The truth is, decisions are made in these rooms. Priorities shift, resources move, and narratives take form. If your voice isn't part of that process, your expertise risks being sidelined, sometimes by someone with far less technical insight, but far more vocal presence. Speaking up is not about ego or airtime; it's about advocacy, clarity, and long-term influence.</p>

            <p>Here are some powerful tools to make your presence felt:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><b>Presence is Not Just Participation</b>
                <p>Visibility is not the same as impact. Speaking just to be seen can dilute your credibility. Influence grows when your words are thoughtful, aligned with your role, and strategically timed. Don't aim to dominate the conversation; aim to shape it. One strong insight can do more than five surface-level comments.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Preparation is Power</b>
                <p>Before you walk into the room, prepare one or two points related deeply to the agenda. Anticipate questions. Frame insights around business outcomes or user impact. Being prepared allows you to speak with clarity and confidence.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Timing is a Strategic Tool</b>
                <p>Look for moments of ambiguity or transition during the meeting, for eg, When decisions are forming or directions are being reconsidered. That's your cue. Add clarity, flag potential risks, or offer grounded alternatives. Don't wait to be called on. Influence is seized not assigned.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Say Less, Mean More</b>
                <p>Speak in specific, actionable language. Instead of vague commentary like "That might not work," say, "We saw better results last quarter when we personalized user flows, could we test that approach here?" The goal is to bring solutions, not just opinions.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Follow Through to Be Heard</b>
                <p>Your influence doesn't end when the meeting does. Reinforce your point in follow-up messages or one-on-one conversations. Repetition builds recall and recall builds trust. Over time, your voice will be one they turn to, not just tolerate.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>You're Not Just Speaking for You</b>
                <p>As a senior engineer or leader, your voice carries the weight of your team's expertise. When you speak, you advocate for your team and function. When you stay silent, that voice may be lost. Presence is power, not for its own sake, but because it shapes the path of your team.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Start Now, Build Over Time</b>
                <p>You don't have to speak in every meeting. But you do have to show up with intention. Consistency builds recognition. Recognition builds trust. And trust unlocks influence.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Make sure your voice is heard in the next meeting. Good luck!</p>
