        <h2>Why Your Voice Matters: Conveying Presence in Leadership Meetings as a Senior Engineer</h2>

        <p>As a Senior Software Engineer, your technical contributions are already valuable. But in meetings with senior
            leadership—directors, VPs, and cross-functional leaders—how you show up is just as important as what you
            know. Quietly listening can sometimes be mistaken for disengagement or lack of conviction. Presence, not
            just participation, is how influence begins.</p>

        <h3>Why Presence Matters</h3>

        <h4>You’re Representing More Than Yourself</h4>
        <p>As a senior engineer, you represent the voice of engineering on a project or domain. When you don’t speak,
            it’s not just your voice that’s missing—it’s the voice of the engineering discipline.</p>

        <h4>Decisions Get Made in the Room</h4>
        <p>Senior leadership meetings are where priorities shift, tradeoffs are made, and projects live or die. If
            you’re silent, others will fill the gap—even if they don’t fully understand the technical stakes.</p>

        <h4>Quiet Confidence Isn’t Always Recognized</h4>
        <p>You may think, “I’ll speak if I have something really important to say.” That’s fair. But leadership often
            interprets visible engagement—questions, clarifications, short summaries—as signals of ownership and
            credibility.</p>

        <h4>You're Building Long-Term Influence</h4>
        <p>Speaking up regularly builds familiarity and trust. Over time, this allows you to shape future strategy, not
            just respond to it.</p>
